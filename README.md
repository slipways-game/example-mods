# example-mods

This repository contains the example mods for Slipways. Their purpose is to show you how to add different types of things to Slipways using the modding functionality.

# Installation

* Download the mods from Github by **clicking the green "Code" button, and selecting "Download ZIP."**
* Extract the archive.
* Copy all the directories starting with `example-` and `template-` to your Slipways mod folder.
    * You can find the mod folder by opening the 'manage mods' window in game. The path will be shown at the bottom of the window.

Alternatively, if you're playing on Steam, you can subscribe to all the example mods on the Steam Workshop.

# Usage

You can use these mods as learning tools, or as starting points for your own mods. To create a new mod based on an example or a template:

* Copy the whole mod to a new subdirectory in the mod folder, eg. 'my-awesome-mod'
* Go inside the folder and delete any files starting with a dot, eg `.pid`, `.sid`, to create a clean new "identity" for your mod
* Start editing from there
